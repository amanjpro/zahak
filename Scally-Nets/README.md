  
Smaller / Weaker Zahak NETs by Alan Cooper (Al) aka Scally, for use as Levels for Human Play for Picochess or any Chess GUI
  
These were all built on a Raspberry Pi 4 booted from a SD Drive with a M.2 backup drive using the latest Zahak Engine to generate the EPDs, Cutechess & Zahak to produce the PGNs, fengen to produce the FENs & zahak-trainer to produce the new NETs 
 
Thanks to Amanj for being very patient in helping me understand the processes.  

When we first started this Project we believed that the best NETs were those with the lowest Validation Cost, so I was literally creating hundreds and in some cases thousands of NETs until the lowest Validation Cost was reached. Earlier NETs were produced with a smaller NetInputSize of 768, so all work done on these were scrapped after Amanj increased this size to 769 when adding tempo into the network architecture.  
  
It later become apparent that we were overtraining these NETs, so we settled for producing no more than 50 and testing these for strength.  
  
Amanj was producing the strongest NET available, trying NET sizes of 769 x 128 x 1, then 769 x 256 x 1 & now 769 x 512 x 1.  
  
My aim was to try and produce weaker NETs, so after trying 769 x 128 x 1, then 769 x 64 x 1, I settled for 769 x 32 x 1.  
  
Whilst I was creating & testing my NETs, Amanj was fine tuning his code, so as soon as I produced NETs that were tested at grade X, they became stronger with his new code.  
  
I have settled on the following NETs, these are all based on the grade for Zahak v0.2.1 set at 1824 elo.

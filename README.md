A UCI compatible chess AI written in Go. Still work in progress. Zahak is also
compliant with [open-benchmark](https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench).

# The name

Zahak (or Zahhak or Azhi Dahak) is an evil figure in Iranian/Kurdish/Perisan
mythology, evident in ancient Iranian folklore as Azhi DahƒÅka, the name by
which he also appears in the texts of the Avesta.  Legend has it, that he had two
giant snakes on his shoulders and he had to feed them two human brains on
daily basis, you can read more about him
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahhak)

# Play Zahak online

Zahak is new to LiChess, you can play him and be impressed with him. His
LiChess handle is [zahak_engine](https://lichess.org/@/zahak_engine). He is
currently running on an old RaspberryPi device, so do not expect a truly
amazing performance. But, hopefully he will be online 24/7.

# Play Zahak on your Android Phone/Desktop

Zahak is a bare chess engine AI, that means it doesn't come with any GUI
interface.  That also means, it is easy to plug it into any chess GUI that
supports UCI protocol.

- [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/)
- [CuteChess](https://cutechess.com/)
- [Tarrasch](https://www.triplehappy.com/)
- [The Shredder GUI](https://www.shredderchess.com/)
- [Fritz / Chessbase series](https://en.chessbase.com/)
- [Scid vs PC (database)](http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/)
- [Banksia GUI](https://banksiagui.com/)
- [DroidFish](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.petero.droidfish) is a good choice on Android

# Tournaments

Zahak is participating in [ZaTour tournament series](https://zatour.amanj.me) for open source and original chess engines
that are rated lower than 2800 as per CCRL.

He is also participating in the tournaments arranged by [Chess Engine
Diaries](https://chessengines.blogspot.com/), and several others.

# Rating

Zahak is in the [CCRL Blitz ratings](https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/404/) as
well as the [4040
rating](https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?family=Zahak&print=Rating+list&print=Results+table&print=LOS+table&print=Ponder+hit+table&print=Eval+difference+table&print=Comopp+gamenum+table&print=Overlap+table&print=Score+with+common+opponents).
He is also listed in [Rebel's Gambit rating (i.e.
GRL)](http://rebel13.nl/grl-40-2.html), in time control 40 moves in 2 minutes.
__Please Note__ that GRL tests the engiens with their default hash size, which
means it doesn't really represent the actual strength/weakness of the engines
in the list.  As of version 4.0, Zahak is also listed on [CEGT 40/4 Rating
List](http://www.cegt.net/blitz.htm).

The history of Zahak's rating is summerized here:

# Opening Books

Currently only PolyGlot is supported. Then engine doesn't come with any books,
but you can attach your favourite one easily by passing the path to `-book`
command: `zahak -book PATH_TO_BOOK`.

A bunch of free books are available [here](https://github.com/michaeldv/donna_opening_books)

# Building

To build the project, simply run `make build`, testing with `make test`, and running with `make run`.
Other features exist, for example you can run `perft` with `./zahak -perft` or profile it with `./zahak -profile`.
You can also run it in perfttree mode with `./zahak -preft-tree`.

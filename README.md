A UCI compatible chess AI written in Go. Still work in progress. 

Courtesy to the OpenBench community, Zahak is now part of the [official
OpenBench instance](http://chess.grantnet.us/index/)

# The name

Zahak (or Zahhak or Azhi Dahak) is an evil figure in Iranian/Kurdish/Perisan
mythology, evident in ancient Iranian folklore as Azhi DahƒÅka, the name by
which he also appears in the texts of the Avesta.  Legend has it, that he had two
giant snakes on his shoulders and he had to feed them two human brains on
daily basis, you can read more about him
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahhak)

# Play Zahak online

Zahak is new to LiChess, you can play him and be impressed with him. His
LiChess handle is [zahak_engine](https://lichess.org/@/zahak_engine).

# Play Zahak on your Android Phone/Desktop

Zahak is a bare chess engine AI, that means it doesn't come with any GUI
interface.  That also means, it is easy to plug it into any chess GUI that
supports UCI protocol.

# Skill Levels

Anchored around Rustic Alpha 3, I found that, based on CCRL the ratings will
probably translate to the following:

- Skill Level 1: 1270
- Skill Level 2: 1440
- Skill Level 3: 1630
- Skill Level 4: 1856
- Skill Level 5: 2004
- Skill Level 6: 2074

# Opening Books

Currently only PolyGlot is supported. Then engine doesn't come with any books,
but you can attach your favourite one easily by passing the path to `-book`
command: `zahak -book PATH_TO_BOOK`.

A bunch of free books are available [here](https://github.com/michaeldv/donna_opening_books)

# Training Networks

Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/amanjpro/zahak/blob/master/training.md).

# Building

To build the project, simply run `make build`, testing with `make test`, and running with `make run`.
Other features exist, for example you can run `perft` with `./zahak -perft` or profile it with `./zahak -profile`.
You can also run it in perfttree mode with `./zahak -preft-tree`.

# Contributors

Thanks to the following for their valuable contributions:

- Basti Dangca: for generating data for training Zahak's network
- Alan Cooper (Scally): for generating weaker networks for different skill levels.
